# Refactoring Legacy Codebase - README

## Introduction
This repository contains a refactored version of the legacy codebase for `excelservice-1.0`. The objective of this refactoring effort is to improve the maintainability, readability, and extensibility of the codebase while adhering to best practices and principles of software development.

## Process and Principles Followed

### 1. Identify Problematic Areas:
- Conducted a thorough code review to identify areas of concern such as:
    - Code smells (repetitive code, excessive complexity).
    - Violations of SOLID principles.
    - Lack of separation of concerns.
    - Poor naming conventions.

### 2. Plan Refactoring Strategy:
- Established a clear plan for refactoring, focusing on one principle or area at a time.
- Prioritized refactoring tasks based on the impact on code quality and maintainability.

### 3. Apply SOLID Principles.

### 4. Clean Code Practices.

## Examples of Changes Made

### 1. Separation of Concerns:
- **Before**:
    - Business logic, Excel generation, and email sending were mixed in the `ExportCampaignService`.
- **After**:
    - Extracted Excel generation and email sending into separate service classes (`ExcelService` and `MailService`).

### 2. Reusability:
- **Before**:
    - Excel generation code was duplicated in the `sendResults` method.
- **After**:
    - Extracted Excel generation logic into a reusable helper class (`ExcelService`).

### 3. MissUse of Component vs Service:
- **Before**:
    - A service with business logic was a generic component.
- **After**:
    - I annotated it with Service.


### 4. Error Handling:
- **Before**:
    - Error handling was minimal and generic.
- **After**:
    - Introduced more granular exception types and handled them appropriately for better error reporting.

## Conclusion
Through systematic refactoring guided by SOLID principles and clean code practices, the legacy codebase has been transformed into a more maintainable and extensible solution. The process focused on improving code quality, readability, and testability while minimizing technical debt and reducing the risk of introducing regressions.
